## Introduction 
This plugin for [ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/) allows you to view, set and reset achievements in steam games, similar to [SAM](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager). Works only with ASF v4.0+ (make sure to check actual required version in release notes). 

## Installation
- download `AutoAchievementManager.zip` file from [latest release](https://github.com/JackieWaltRyan/ASF-Achievement-Manager/releases/latest).
- create new folder (for example, `AutoAchievementManager`) in the `plugins` folder of your ASF installation
- unpack downloaded .zip file to the folder you just created.
- optionally, configure plugin properties in ASF.json file (see below).
- (re)start ASF, you should get a message indicating that plugin loaded successfully. 

## Usage
After installation, you can use those commands (only for accounts with Master+ permissions):

### `alist <bots> <appids>`
Displays current status of achievements in specified games on given bots. You can specify multiple bots and multiple appids.<br/>
Example of output:<br/>

Unlocked achievements are marked as ✅, still locked as ❌. If achievement has mark ⚠️ next to it - it means this achievement is server-side, and can't be switched with this plugin.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
  `alist bot1 370910,730`<br/>
  `alist bot1,bot2 370910`
  
### `aset <bots> <appid> <achievements>`
Sets (unlocks) achievements with specified numbers in provided appid on given bots. Please note that, unlike `alist`, you can provide only one appid here. Achievement numbers corresponds to the ones showed by `alist` command. You can provide `*` instead of achievements list to set all available achievements.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
  `aset bot1 370910 1,2,5`<br/>
  `aset bot1,bot2 370910 1`<br/>
  `aset bot1 370910 *`
  
### `areset <bots> <appid> <achievements>`
Resets (locks) achievements with specified numbers in provided appid on given bots. Please note that, unlike `alist`, you can provide only one appid here. Achievement numbers corresponds to the ones showed by `alist` command. You can provide `*` instead of achievements list to reset all available achievements.<br/>
Examples:<br/>
  `areset bot1 370910 1,2,5`<br/>
  `areset bot1..bot3 370910 2`<br/>
  `areset bot1 370910 *`

## Configuration
This plugins adds one additional property in global ASF config (ASF.json).

### `AchievementsCulture`
Property of `string` type, with default value equal to `null`, that determines in what language you want to see achievement names, if available. If value is `null`, or invalid culture is provided, plugin will fallback to the global culture set in ASF (see [`CurrentCulture`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#currentculture)).
Accepted values are the same as for [`CurrentCulture`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#currentculture) global ASF property, but please note that only languages actually provided in steam could be displayed, if there is no specified language provided in Steam - plugin will fallback to English names.

Example:

`"AchievementsCulture":"uk-UA"`
